# firstTextAdventure
My first text adventure game in C++

it's not very long, and is definitely made with spaghetti code, but it was a first project and I haven't learned a whole lot yet.
Yes, I know there's a few spots where things just kinda end, I'll possibly go back and made adjustments to this once I learn more, but for now it's probably fine.
Hope you enjoy it!
