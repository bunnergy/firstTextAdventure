# firstTextAdventure
My first text adventure game in C++

it's not very long, and is definitely made with spaghetti code, but it was a first project and I haven't learned a whole lot yet.
Yes, I know there's a few spots where things just kinda end, I'll possibly go back and made adjustments to this once I learn more, but for now it's probably fine.
I also realize the "dinner" path is the weakest, but I was exhausted and really couldn't think of a good way to mess it up, so that'll also be updated later on.
For now, I hope you enjoy it
